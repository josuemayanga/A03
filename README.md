<h1> How to use Webstorm</h1>

<p>WebStorm is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for JavaScript, developed by JetBrains. Here are some general steps to help you get started with WebStorm:

Installation: Download and install WebStorm from the JetBrains website. You may need to create an account if you don't already have one.

Creating a project: To create a new project in WebStorm, click on "File" > "New" > "Project". Select the type of project you want to create (e.g. Node.js, React, Angular), choose a location for your project, and configure any other settings you need.

Code editing: Once you have a project open, you can create and edit files in the project directory. WebStorm provides many features to make coding easier, such as code completion, code formatting, and debugging.

Running and testing code: You can run and test your code directly from WebStorm. To run a file or project, click on the "Run" icon in the top-right corner of the screen, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+F10 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+F10 (Mac).

Version control: WebStorm has built-in support for version control systems such as Git. You can manage your code changes and commit them to a repository directly from WebStorm.

Plugins and customization: WebStorm has a large library of plugins that you can use to customize your development environment. To install a plugin, go to "File" > "Settings" > "Plugins" and search for the plugin you want.
