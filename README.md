<h1> How to use Webstorm</h1>

<p>WebStorm is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for JavaScript, developed by JetBrains. Here are some general steps to help you get started with WebStorm:

Installation: Download and install WebStorm from the JetBrains website. You may need to create an account if you don't already have one.

Creating a project: To create a new project in WebStorm, click on "File" > "New" > "Project". Select the type of project you want to create (e.g. Node.js, React, Angular), choose a location for your project, and configure any other settings you need.

Code editing: Once you have a project open, you can create and edit files in the project directory. WebStorm provides many features to make coding easier, such as code completion, code formatting, and debugging.

Running and testing code: You can run and test your code directly from WebStorm. To run a file or project, click on the "Run" icon in the top-right corner of the screen, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+F10 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+F10 (Mac).

Version control: WebStorm has built-in support for version control systems such as Git. You can manage your code changes and commit them to a repository directly from WebStorm.

Plugins and customization: WebStorm has a large library of plugins that you can use to customize your development environment. To install a plugin, go to "File" > "Settings" > "Plugins" and search for the plugin you want.

<h1> How to use GIT</h1>
<p> Git is a popular version control system that allows you to manage changes to your code and collaborate with others. Here are some basic steps to help you get started with using Git:

Installation: Download and install Git from the official website for your operating system.

Configuration: Once you have Git installed, you need to configure your username and email address so that your commits can be attributed to you. Open a terminal or Git Bash and run the following commands, replacing "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your own information:
  
  Initializing a repository: To start using Git in a project, you need to create a repository. Navigate to the directory where your project is located and run the following command:
  
  This will create a new Git repository in your project directory.

Adding and committing files: Before you can start tracking changes to your code, you need to add your files to the staging area. To add all files in the current directory and its subdirectories, run:
  
  Add specific file,run: 
  
  Once you have added your files, you can commit the changes with a message that describes the changes you made:
  
  Viewing the commit history: You can view the history of your commits with the git log command. This will show you a list of all the commits in the repository, along with the commit message, author, date, and a unique hash for each commit.

Branching and merging: Git allows you to create branches to work on different features or versions of your code in parallel. To create a new branch, run:
  
  These are just some of the basic steps to get started with using Git. Git has many more features and options to explore, so it's worth taking the time to learn more about what it can do. There are many tutorials and resources available online to help you learn Git.
